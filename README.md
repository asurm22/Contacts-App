# Contacts-App
An iOS app built with UIKit that displays contacts grouped into alphabetic sections. Each section can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the associated contacts. This project demonstrates custom table view headers, model binding via closures, and a dynamic UI with smooth section reloads.

Features

- Group contacts by the first letter of their names
- Expand/collapse contact groups by tapping a header button
- Custom UITableViewHeaderFooterView for section headers
- MVVM-inspired data modeling with HeaderModel and Contact
